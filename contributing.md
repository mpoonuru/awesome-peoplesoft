# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
  * Packages should be tested and documented.
  * Articles and tutorials should be in-depth or provide a solution to a particular problem; no high-level feature overviews.
* Use the following format: `[package/title](link) - Description.`
  * Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
  * If an article title is self-explanatory, the description may be omitted.
  * Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
  * Don't mention `PeopleSoft` in the description, as it's implied
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome,
but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
